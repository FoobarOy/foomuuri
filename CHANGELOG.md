# ChangeLog

## 0.29 (20xx-xx-xx)

* Add `snat_prefix` and `dnat_prefix` statements for IPv6-to-IPv6 Network
  Prefix Translation (NPTv6).
* Deprecate unneeded `to` after `snat` and `dnat` statements. It's quietly
  ignored.
* Add `tproxy` matcher for transparent proxying.
* Add `mss pmtu` to calculate the MTU in runtime based on what the routing
  cache has observed via Path MTU Discovery.
* Fix: `mss` applies to IPv4 and IPv6. Previously it was only for IPv4.
* Add `input` section. It processes incoming packets with destination
  `localhost`.
* Add `try-reload` command to safely test new config. It will load new config,
  ask confirmation from user to keep new config, and revert back to old config
  if user didn't reply in 15 seconds.
* Foomuuri Monitor supports and prefers fping's `--squiet=s` mode. It works
  correctly even if the interface is down. fping command option `--interval=ms`
  is automatically converted to correct value.
* Add `command_down_interval` and `down_interval` to Foomuuri Monitor.
  Foomuuri Monitor will run that external command in regular intervals if
  network connectivity is still down.
* Default log prefix can be configured with `foomuuri { log_prefix "..." }`.
* Variables `$(szone)`, `$(dzone)` and `$(statement)` can be used in log
  prefix.
* More text to default log prefix can be added with `log + "mytext"`.
* Multiple interfaces can be specified to `iifname` and `oifname` matchers.
  Negative matching also works.
* Print `list counter` command output in pretty format.
* Add `prometheus`, `prometheus-*` and `alertmanager` macros to default
  services.
* Add `--fork` command line option to fork as a background daemon process.
  This applies to `monitor` and `dbus` only.
* Add `--syslog` command line option to enable syslog logging.
* Add bash-completion (requires v2.12 or newer) script.

## 0.28 (2025-04-15)

* Merge `iplist` and `resolve` sections to unified `iplist`. Old config will
  work as is, but updating it to new `iplist` format is recommended: simply
  rename `resolve {}` to `iplist {}` and check timeout and refresh options.
* Add `url_timeout=10d`, `url_refresh=1d`, `dns_timeout=24h` and
  `dns_refresh=15m` options to `iplist` section to specify expiry timeout and
  refresh interval for URLs (HTTP or file) and resolved hostnames.
  * Old `timeout` and `refresh` options are deprecated. They set both `url_XXX`
    and `dns_XXX` values.
* Downloaded `iplist` content can be filtered:
  * `|shell:/path/to/command` pipe it via external command.
  * `|json:filter` use external `jq` command to parse it as JSON data.
  * `|html:XPath` parse it as HTML data.
  * `|xml:XPath` parse it as XML data.
  * `|missing-ok` don't print warning if URL download or DNS resolve fails.
* Improve `template foo` handling to support matchers and everything else that
  macros support.
* Add `prerouting filter raw` and similar sections to allow specifying chain
  type and hook priority.
* Add `notrack` statement to be used in prerouting section to mark packet to
  not be added to conntrack.
* Add `10 mbytes/second` per byte support to rate limits (`global_rate` etc).
* Add `over` support to rate limits to be used with `drop` statement.
* Add `dscp` matcher to match packet's DSCP value.
* Add `bgp` macro to default services.

## 0.27 (2025-01-28)

* BREAKING CHANGES:
  * Previously `mark_set` was a statement. Now it's a matcher and rule's
    default statement `accept` is used if not specified. Usually `accept` is
    what you want to use. To keep previous behavior use `mark_set XX continue`.
  * `mark_save` and `mark_restore` are removed. They are automatically added
    when needed.
  * Multi-ISP example in GitHub wiki is updated to match above changes.
* Add `priority_set` to set packet's traffic control class id.
* Add `priority_match` to check packet's traffic control class id.
* Add `nbd`, `pxe`, `salt`, and `tor` related macros to default services.
* Add `--quiet` command line option to suppress warnings.
* Print warning in `foomuuri check` if macro is overwritten.
* Add more checks for invalid rules, like `ssh saddr` without address.
* Add filters to `foomuuri list`:
  * `foomuuri list macro http https`: specified macros.
  * `foomuuri list macro 80 443`: macros that include value 80 or 443.
  * `foomuuri list counter traffic_in traffic_out`: specified counters.
* Fix: `foomuuri iplist refresh` actually refreshes it now, no need for
  `--force`. Option `--soft` checks for next refresh time.

## 0.26 (2024-11-13)

* Add `iplist flush name` command to delete all entries in iplist.
* Add support for `-macro`, `macro/24`, `[macro]:123` and `macro:123` in
  macro expansion.
* Add support for `icmp echo-request` (and other names) in addition to
  `icmp 8`. Use name in default `ping` macro instead of number.
* Add `--force` command line option to force iplist refresh now.
* Write `foomuuri-monitor` states and statistics to a file once a minute.
* Add `rtsps` macro to default services.
* Fix: Add range support to `iplist list`.
* Fix: `iplist add` and `iplist del` didn't work correctly on all cases.

## 0.25 (2024-10-01)

* Add `status` command to show if Foomuuri is running, current zone-interface
  mapping.
* Add `set interface eth0 zone public` command to change interface to zone.
* Add `set interface eth0 zone -` command to remove interface from all zones.
* Add `queue` statement. It forwards packet to userspace, used for example
  for IPS/IDS.
* Rules in `any-public` section will be added to `public-public` too.
* Improve syntax error checks for rules.
* More relaxed import for external `iplist` lists: handle `;` as comment,
  allow overlapping IP ranges.
* IP address with or without netmask can be used as `resolve` or `iplist`
  entry.
* Add warning if `resolve` hostname doesn't resolve or whole set is empty.
* Add `ipsec-nat`, `pop3s`, `gluster-client`, `gluster-management`, `amqp`,
  `snmptrap` and `activedirectory` macros to default services.
* Automatically add final `drop log` rule to zone-zone section if it is
  missing for improved logging.
* Fix: Allow using nft's reserved words like `inet` as interface name or
  uid/gid.
* Fix: Don't traceback if `resolve` or `iplist` refresh takes over 60 second
  on `foomuuri reload`.

## 0.24 (2024-06-19)

* Remove `start-or-good` command line option. Add systemd
  `foomuuri-boot.service` to implement same functionality safer.
* Add `block` command line option to load "block all traffic" ruleset.
* Add `continue` statement. Rule `saddr 192.168.1.1 counter log continue`
  counts and logs traffic from 192.168.1.1 and continues to next rules.
* Add `time` matcher to check hour, date and weekday.
* Add `mac_saddr` and `mac_daddr` matchers to match MAC address. This works
  only for incoming traffic.
* Add `ct_status` matcher to match conntrack status, for example `dnat` or
  `snat`.
* Add `cgroup` matcher to match cgroup id or cgroupv2 name.
* Add `-conntrack` flag to rule. This rule will be outputted before
  conntrack. This can be used to count all specific traffic, or to accept
  some traffic without adding it to conntrack (for example high load DNS
  server).
* Add `redis`, `redis-sentinel`, `vnc`, `domain-quic` (DoQ) and `domain-tls`
  (DoT) macros to default services.
* Matcher `szone -public` in `any-localhost` (or `dzone` in `localhost-any`)
  section can be used to skip adding rule to `public-localhost`.
* Allow using any command (`curl` example included) instead of `fping` in
  network connectivity monitor.
* Allow `foomuuri { nft_bin nft --optimize }` to specify options.
* Fix: `counter myname` didn't work on `prerouting` section.
* Fix: Restart network connectivity monitor `command` if it fails to start
  or dies.

## 0.23 (2024-03-20)

* Rework `multicast` and `broadcast` handling for incoming/outgoing traffic.
  This simplifies macros and results more optimal ruleset.
* Allow outgoing IGMP multicast membership reports, incoming IGMP query.
* Change default `log_level` to `level info flags skuid` to include UID/GID
  for locally generated traffic.
* Add `invalid`, `rpfilter` and `smurfs` sections to accept specific
  traffic that is normally dropped.
* Add `ospf` macro to default services.
* Add support for negative set matching `saddr -@geoip drop`
* Fix: Separate `counter` and `accept counter` rules.
* Fix: Better output for `foomuuri check` if not running as root.
* Fix: Handle D-Bus change event for `lo` interface better.

## 0.22 (2023-12-12)

* Add `protocol` matcher, for example `protocol gre` accepts GRE traffic.
* Add support for `localhost-localhost` section and rules. If not defined,
  it defaults to `accept`.
* Rule's log level can be set with `log_level "level crit"`. This overrides
  global `foomuuri { log_level ... }` setting.
* Iplist refresh interval can be configured globally and per-iplist.
* Pretty output for `foomuuri iplist list` instead of raw nft output.
* Fix handling "[ipv6]", "[ipv6]/mask" and "[ipv6]:port" notations.
